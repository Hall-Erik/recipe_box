		<p>recipe_box is a place for you to share and find new recipes, but it's mostly here so I can practice my programming skills. This is a work in progress, so things may change from time to time. View the Github page for this site <a href="https://github.com/Hall-Erik/recipe_box">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Feel free to <a href="{{ url_for('users.register') }}">create an account</a> and start sharing.</p>
